## Good sentences

* The first is about the stunned horror of a woman who lost, in one
  moment, her past, present, and future.

* Grief is a frightening condition, and at its extreme is like the
  sun: impossible to look at directly.
  
*  Grief and rage - you need to contain that, to put a frame around
  it, where it can play itself out without you or your kin having to
  die. There is a theory that watching unbearable stories about other
  people lost in grief and rage is good for you - may cleanse you of
  darkness. Do you want to go down to the pits of yourself all alone?
  Not much. What if an actor could do it for you? Isn't that why they
  are called actors? They act for you. [1]
  
* Writing is a much better quality of agony than trying to forget.
