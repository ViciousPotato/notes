## JAXB
Java architecture for XML binding[1]

SAX and DOM JAXP

complex type means have children

**Is this thing really necessary??**
**I really can't get used to Java stuff**


## Spring
The truth about spring is that it uses configurations files instead of
code?

Is this really a good practice?

I wish there be a book covering Java tools, frameworks and patterns.
